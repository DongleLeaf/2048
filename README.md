# PINK 2048
This is PINK 2048 which is based on Udacity version of 2048.  

We use pink colors instead of numbers.

You can see a PINK 2048 demo [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/DongleLeaf/2048/blob/gh-pages/index.html)

### Notes for the Udacity version
A Udacity version of Gabriele Cirulli's [original 2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/). 

The original version is a small clone of [1024](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.veewo.a1024), based on [Saming's 2048](http://saming.fr/p/2048/) (also a clone).

We're using this version as the recommended fork to avoid potential learning issues as the original source changes (and the Udacity videos don't update). You can [fork the original repo as well](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048)

## Donations
Gabriele made this in his spare time, and it's hosted on GitHub (which means I don't have any hosting costs), but if you enjoyed the game and feel like buying him coffee, you can donate at his BTC address: `1Ec6onfsQmoP9kkL3zkpB6c5sA4PVcXU2i`.
